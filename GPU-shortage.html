          <h2>The GPU crisis</h2>
          <img src="global-warming.jpg" alt="GPU Shortage" />
          <p>
            The GPU crisis in 2025 has reached unprecedented levels. NVIDIA has
            warned of a potential shortage of next-generation RTX 50-series
            graphics cards, which is expected to begin in 2025. This shortage is
            primarily driven by the surging demand for AI-powered technologies
            and the limited manufacturing capacity of advanced chips.
          </p>

          <h3>Causes of the GPU Shortage</h3>
          <p>The main causes of the GPU shortage include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Surging demand for AI-powered technologies, particularly in data
              centers and research labs
            </li>
            <li>Manufacturing constraints and supply chain disruptions</li>
            <li>
              Allocation of a significant portion of new GPUs to
              high-performance AI applications
            </li>
            <li>
              Global chip shortage affecting the entire semiconductor industry
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Effects of the GPU Shortage</h3>
          <p>
            The GPU shortage has far-reaching effects on various industries and
            consumers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Limited availability of graphics cards, especially for gamers and
              individual consumers
            </li>
            <li>
              Inflated prices, with some GPUs selling for 30-50% above MSRP
            </li>
            <li>Disruption in PC building and gaming markets</li>
            <li>Delays in AI research and development projects</li>
            <li>
              Increased competition between consumer and enterprise markets for
              available GPUs
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Potential Solutions to the GPU Shortage</h3>
          <p>
            Addressing the GPU shortage requires efforts from manufacturers,
            retailers, and consumers. Some potential solutions include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Expanding manufacturing capacity and partnerships with additional
              fabrication facilities
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementing purchase limits and anti-scalping measures at
              retailers
