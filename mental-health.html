          <p>
            AI-powered cyber attacks have emerged as a significant challenge in
            the cybersecurity landscape of 2025. Cybercriminals are leveraging
            artificial intelligence to enhance the sophistication and impact of
            their attacks, making them increasingly elusive and harder to
            detect.
          </p>

          <h3>Impact of AI-Powered Cyber Attacks</h3>
          <p>The rise of AI-powered cyber attacks has several implications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Automated vulnerability identification and exploitation</li>
            <li>Creation of more convincing phishing schemes</li>
            <li>Real-time adaptation to circumvent security measures</li>
            <li>
              Increased difficulty in distinguishing between genuine and
              malicious content
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Types of AI-Enhanced Threats</h3>
          <p>
            AI is being used to enhance various types of cyber threats,
            including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Deepfake technology for creating realistic fake videos and audio
            </li>
            <li>AI-enhanced malware attacks</li>
            <li>Advanced social engineering tactics</li>
            <li>Sophisticated ransomware operations</li>
            <li>AI-driven data exfiltration techniques</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Combating AI-Powered Cyber Attacks</h3>
          <p>
            To address the growing threat of AI-powered cyber attacks,
            organizations and cybersecurity professionals are adopting various
            strategies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Investing in AI-driven security solutions</li>
            <li>Implementing robust AI governance platforms</li>
            <li>Enhancing threat detection and response capabilities</li>
            <li>
              Adopting stronger forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA)
            </li>
            <li>Implementing zero trust architecture</li>
