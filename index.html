            The GPU crisis in 2025 has reached unprecedented levels. NVIDIA has
            warned of a potential shortage of next-generation RTX 50-series
            graphics cards, which is expected to begin in 2025. This shortage is
            primarily driven by the surging demand for AI-powered technologies
            and the limited manufacturing capacity of advanced chips.

            Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual
            realizes their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of
            life, can work productively, and is able to make a contribution to
            their community. Explore the importance of mental health and ways to
            maintain it.

            AI bias refers to the potential for artificial intelligence systems
            to exhibit biased behavior or produce biased results due to the
            data, algorithms, or design choices used in their development. Learn
            about the risks and challenges associated with AI bias.
